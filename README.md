# Personal Learning Project

This project was developed as part of my journey to learn Python. It is intended for personal use and as a learning exercise. You're welcome to explore the code, and free to use it as inspiration for your own learning projects.

I'd like to thank Ardit Sulce, whose excellent course I had the opportunity to follow on Udemy.com ('Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 60 Days, Build 20 Apps').
